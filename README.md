**Program which demonstrates machine learning in Octave.**

You need to install Octave on your computer, here are<br>
some clues.  Worry about hammering later, good practice.<br>

<b>I'm using:</b>
<pre>el@apollo:/workspace/octave_machine_learning_demo$ octave -v 
GNU Octave, version 3.8.1
</pre>


<b>Run it like this:<br></b>

<pre>
octave logisticTest.m
</pre>

<b>How it works, 10 thousand foot view:<br></b>

It runs the machine learning algorithm described by Sebastian Thrun,<br>
Andrew NG, and Michael Littman and uses those principles to <br>
take a set of feature data and create a neural network which itself<br>
is a map that can guide a user to take unknown inputs and use that<br>
to calculate the final answer.<br>

<b>Can it be used to time the stock market?</b><br>
Yes, and I did, for a time, and it works, right up until the other AI's at <br>
the citadel in Boston smells you sets you up for a fall. However, understand <br>
that in this, you're about 20 years late to the party.  This stuff was hammered<br>
out back in the 1960's and 1980's, already tuned to perfection by hundreds of <br>
big money hedge funds earning billions of dollars per year off the backs of you <br>
and I who keep their claims on future human labor on receipts of paper that a<br>
private central bank inflate away after socializing the treasury.<br>
