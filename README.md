**A program which demonstrates machine learning in Octave.**

Install GNU Octave on your computer.

<b>I'm using:</b>

<pre>el@apollo:/workspace/octave_machine_learning_demo$ octave -v 
GNU Octave, version 3.8.1
</pre>

http://www.something.com/what_ever

<b>Run it like this:<br></b>

<pre>
octave logisticTest.m
</pre>

<b>How it works, 10 thousand foot view:<br></b>

It runs the machine learning algorithm described by Sebastian Thrun,<br>
Andrew NG, and Michael Littman and uses those principles to <br>
take a set of feature data and create a neural network which itself<br>
is a map that can guide a user to take unknown inputs and use that<br>
to calculate the final answer.<br>
<br>
<b>Low level details on how/why it works:</b>

<b>Can it be used to time the stock market?</b><br>
Yes, and I did, for a time, and it works, right up until the other AI's at <br>
the citadel in Boston smells you and sets you up for a fall.
